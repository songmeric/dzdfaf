# PTP Client Capability of the Arista 7150 Series

## Summary

The **Arista 7150 Series** supports **IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP)** in both **Boundary Clock** and **Transparent Clock** modes, allowing it to operate as a **PTP client** (slave to a PTP grandmaster).  
Contrary to claims that only the Arista 7130 can function as a PTP client, Arista’s own official documentation confirms that the 7150 has full PTP synchronization capabilities.

### 1. Arista Precision Time Protocol Technical Solution Guide

> “The Arista 7150S Series provides full hardware support for the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) in both boundary clock and transparent clock modes.  
> This enables the switch to synchronize to an upstream master clock and provide accurate timing to downstream devices.”

> “The 7150 Series supports IEEE 1588 Boundary Clock and Transparent Clock modes.  
> As a boundary clock, the switch can operate as a slave to an upstream master, synchronize its local clock, and serve as a master to downstream clients.”

## Conclusion

The **Arista 7150** can indeed act as a PTP client, by functioning in **Boundary Clock** mode and synchronizing to an upstream PTP grandmaster.  
The statement that “only the 7130 can act as a PTP client” is **factually incorrect** according to Arista’s own documentation.
