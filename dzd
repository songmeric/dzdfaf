# Slide 1: Title & Introduction

## **PME - Packet Matching Engine**
### Automated Latency Measurement for GTAD Performance

**Internship Project**
- **Purpose**: Measure trading system performance in CI/CD pipelines
- **Goal**: Catch performance regressions before production releases
- **Impact**: Ensure consistent ultra-low latency trading performance

# Slide 2: Problem Statement

## The Challenge

### Why PME Was Needed

- **Trading systems require microsecond-level latency**
  - Every microsecond matters in high-frequency trading
  - Small performance regressions can cost millions

- **Current Testing Gaps**

  - Difficult to catch subtle latency increases
  - No automated way to measure end-to-end latency in CI/CD

- **Risk of Silent Performance Degradation**
  - Code changes can introduce latency
  - Need to catch issues before production deployment
